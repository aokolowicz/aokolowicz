# Hi, I'm Adrian 👋
###  Data Analyst with a solid engineering background and hands-on experience in industrial 🏭 and research 👨‍🔬 settings.
I graduated from Chemical and Process Engineering[^1]. I’m passionate about providing actionable recommendations that drive business solutions, using **SQL**, **Python**, and **BI tools** to explore data and solve complex problems. I'm also dedicated to creating consumer-oriented business solutions and providing **data-driven insights**. I'm known as a **motivated team player**, understanding the significance of effective teamwork and collaboration in achieving complex goals.

By combining my experience and expertise with IT, I am determined to help industries make the most of their data, optimize their processes, and drive innovation.

- 🌱 Completed the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)—a rigorous, hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process. **See my case study analysis [here](https://github.com/aokolowicz/cyclistic-riders-analysis#cyclistic-bike-share-analyzing-riders-behavior-to-optimize-membership)!**
- 📚 Expanded my computer science and programming knowledge through Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) and [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) courses.
- 📊 **Check out my [article](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11051-023-05872-6)** about the nanoparticle detector I built as a critical business solution enhancing industry safety and risk awareness. Device based on Raspberry Pi Pico (**MicroPython**) and Adafruit's **CircuitPython**.
