# Hi, I'm Adrian 👋
###  Research Scientist and Data Analyst 👨‍🔬 with engineering background 🛠️ and industrial experience 🏭.
I'm passionate about working with **Python** and **MS Excel** to explore data and solve complex problems. I am known as a **motivated team player**, understanding the significance of effective teamwork and collaboration in achieving complex goals. I am also passionate about **creating innovative solutions** and data-driven insights.
By combining my experience and expertise with IT, I am determined to help industries make the most of their data, optimize their processes, and drive innovation.
