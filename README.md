# Hi, I'm Adrian 👋
###  Data Analyst with experience in both research 👨‍🔬 and industrial 🏭 settings.
I graduated from Chemical and Process Engineering. I'm passionate about working with **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, and **MS Excel** to explore data and solve complex problems. I am known as a **motivated team player**, understanding the significance of effective teamwork and collaboration in achieving complex goals.
