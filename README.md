# Hi, I'm Adrian 👋
### Nanoaerosol researcher 👨‍🔬 with engineering background 🛠️ and industrial experience 🏭.
I'm passionate about working with **Python** to explore data and solve complex problems. I am known as a **motivated team player**, understanding the significance of effective teamwork and collaboration in achieving complex goals. I am also passionate about **creating innovative solutions** and data-driven insights.
I would love the opportunity to work professionally with Python and continue to grow in this field.

- 🌱 After the CS50x and CS50P, I am currently continuing **Harvard's CS50 courses**: [CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2023/).
- 📊 In [this article](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11051-023-05872-6) I share the culmination of over a year's dedicated work: measurement device based on Raspberry Pi Pico (**MicroPython**) and Adafruit's **CircuitPython**.
